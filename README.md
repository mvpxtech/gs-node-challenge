# GS Backend Developer (Node.js) test

Make sure you read the whole document carefully and follow the guidelines in it.

## Context

Build a RESTful API that can `get, create, update and delete` user data from a persistence database

### User Model

```
{
  "id": "xxx",                  // user ID 
  "name": "test",               // user name
  "dob": "",                    // date of birth
  "address": "",                // user address
  "description": "",            // user description
  "createdAt": ""               // user created date
}
```

## Requirements

### Functionality

- The API should follow typical RESTful API design pattern.
- The data should be saved in database
- Provide proper API document.

### Tech stack

- Use Node.js and any framework.
- Use any DB. NoSQL DB is preferred.

### Bonus

- Write clear documentation on how it's designed and how to run the code.
- Write good in-code comments.
- Write good commit messages.
- Provide proper unit test.
- Provide a complete user auth (authentication/authorization/etc.) strategy, such as JWT.
